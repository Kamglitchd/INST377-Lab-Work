YOUR NAME Lab 1: Intro to HTML

First, the basics.

You need the following to build your website.

HTML and CSS
Javascript
Node.js
And other web development frameworks

You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.

Learn front-end web design
Learn new programming languages
Learn how to work with others in a technical space
Learn popular web dev frameworks

Let's Try Some Inline Elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

Images 
Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.

onigiri_1
onigiri_2
onigiri_3
onigiri_4

Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
